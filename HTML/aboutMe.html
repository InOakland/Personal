          Hello world! My name is Pairoj Sansri and as you will soon come to find out, I am a man of many talents. Currently, I work in retail sales for a telecommunications company during the week as well as a warehouse on the weekends. As you can imagine, my schedule is pretty busy yet organized as I still find time to study web development throughout the day well as photography somehow in between that. Prior to the pandemic, I also logged quite a few hours at the gym and participated in spartan races.

          At the telecom I help personalize products to customers' needs while maintaining the balance of aligning with company goals. We offer many complex products and services and it is both my job and joy to help the customer navigate through it all, feel great about their purchase, understand the conditions of the deal, have a device that fits them and most importantly that the customer enjoys what we have to offer them. 

 

Prior to sales I also worked in communications with non-profit organizations. I had the pleasure of being the Social Media Manager for Youth Business of America in Oakland, Ca where they work with entrepreneurs, helping them secure funding, a mentor, and a path to success. I also moved up the ranks over the course of seven-years to Communication & Development Associate for McCullum Youth Court, a diversion program for first time youth offenders. We offered a second chance to at-risk youth throughout Alameda county, working in conjunction with law firms such as Wendel Rosen & Black, other youth organizations like Youth Empowerment Program and Youth Uprising to find employment and mentorship opportunities. I personally secured funds for projects from grants issued by Kaiser Permanente, developed many fundraising campaigns through ask-letters, and special events.  Prior to that role and honestly while in that role I also worked in the case management division, developed classes for the clients, provided staff training, and assisted the Executive Director.

          My first hobby was working out, getting introduced to it from my dad who raised me on Arnold Swarzeneggar, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and those classic 80’s & 90’s action film stars. Eventually I started doing martial arts, baseball, cross-country and wrestling as a kid. College was the first time I ever stepped foot in a gym in order to get easy credits and take up some time and I never stopped until the pandemic. I work out like a bodybuilder but enjoy competitive obstacle courses and will occasionally attend. 

 

          I started with videography originally, again thanks to my father. He would take African dance classes and wanted a way for him to see is performances and practice so he bought a camcorder and had me record. I dropped interest but as a young adult with the rise of smart phones I became more interested and everything about them, especially cameras. Eventually this somehow led to me buying a drone for versatility and then a Canon mirrorless camera. I love street photography the most but have been developing an interest in portrait and product photography lately.
